# Workshops

Some of the UWA Makers develop open sourced coursework as part of their contribution to the group and wider community. These courses are then provided by the group to our members at a subsidised cost, and provided to industry members at full cost to help provide funding for the group. They are also made avaialble online for free so that suitably qualified trainers can also run the same courses.
